#watchout
This is a project I completed as a student at
[hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). I worked on it with
[camhux](https://github.com/camhux).  It's a 1980's style surfer game written using
D3. 

Just `npm install` and then open `index.html`. Use the `a` and `s` keys to control
the surfer and avoid sea creatures.
